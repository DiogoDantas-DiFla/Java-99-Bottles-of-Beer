# 99 Bottles of Beer (Java Version)

"**99 Bottles of Beer** or **100 Bottles of Pop on the Wall** is a song dating to the mid-20th century. It is a traditional reverse cumulative song in both the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on road trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize and can take a long time when families sing. In particular, the song is often sung by children on long school bus trips, such as class field trips, or on Scout or Girl Guide outings.

Numerous computer programs exist to output the lyrics to the song. This is analogous to Hello, World! programs, with the addition of a loop. As with Hello World!, this can be a practice exercise for those studying computer programming, and a demonstration of different programming paradigms dealing with looping constructs and syntactic differences between programming languages within a paradigm. 

The program has been written in over 1,500 different programming languages."
